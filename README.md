# LinkedIN-Home-Feed-Hider
This script is to be used in a chrome browser along with tampermonkey extension. 
It will allow you to use linkedin and block the home feed completely. 
After scrip loads (usualy 3-5 sec), space where home feed appears will be completely blank. 
The aim of this script is to allow linkedIN users to avoid seeing home feed and becoming a victim of an endless scroll. 
Remaining parts of feed (like Job Feed or Network Feed) remain unaffected while this script is running.
